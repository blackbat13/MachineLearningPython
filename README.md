# Machine Learning Examples in Python

## Decision Tree

Decision tree is a classification method that splits data into two subsets based on the classification criteria, and then uses those two subsets to split further into further subsets based on the other classification criteria.

## Neural Network for Digits Recognition

Neural network is a multi-layer perceptron with a very wide and deep set of hyperparameters that can find solutions to complex problems.

## Support-Vector Machine (SVM) for Face Recognition

Support vector machine is a supervised learning method that is used to train a neural network model that is able to find the relationship between two given features. In this example it acts as a classification method that uses the features extracted from face images to classify different people into different categories.

## Deep Dreaming

Deep dreaming is the process of generating images of an artistic style using computer vision. It is similar to painting, except that it tries to increase the intensity of the image by changing how the content of the image is encoded.
